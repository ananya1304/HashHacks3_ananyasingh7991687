# Charcha : An inclusive space for personal dialogue 
## Theme 
An important and often stigmatised sector in healthcare is mental health. 
Using this technology, we aim to provide a safe community for people to talk which is the first response in tackling mental health issues. <br/>
## Problem 
Owing to the increasingly stressful lifestyles, there is often an alienation from one’s family and friends. One often finds oneself in a situation of isolation and being alone, with no one to talk to, or hesitation in approaching the people around us. Identifying the importance of mental well-being, Charcha provides an anonymous platform for one to reach out to people around them, and just talk! 
## Overview
The android app works on swipe-based selection criteria for the user who needs someone to talk to -  let’s call the someone Dost.
The user, upon login, is directed to the page with profiles of our Dosts. The profile would display the following information about the Dosts : <br/>
•	City<br/>
•	Profession (for example, student, IT professional, housewife etc)<br/>
•	A brief ‘Bio’ of the Dost, where he/she conveys what they think would be the relevant information about them that would make the ‘match’ between the user and him/her.<br/>
•	Review Star Rating<br/>
Upon right swiping, the user is automatically matched with the Dost, and can go to the ‘ChatRoom’ and reach out to the Dost via text messages. 
**In order to regulate the number of users one Dost is talking to a given time, the app imposes an upper limit on the number of users a Dost can connect to. This is decided to be five, and is subject to change based on the feedback. This ensures that uniform service is provided to all the users.**
## Technologies Used
1.	Android Studio <br/>
2.	Google Firebase <br/>
3.	Dialogue Flow <br/>
4.	Locally created APIs for the algorithms <br/>
## Future Expansion
1.	Dosts would have the option to create a community based on users with similar problems, or users whose mutual, monitored discussion would help in a synergic fashion. <br/>
2.	The conversation between the user and Dost would include video calls.
